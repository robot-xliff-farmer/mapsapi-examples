<div id="references"> <sa href="ready"/>, <sa href="Map"/>
</div>
<p> In this example, the map is created when the &quot;Show map&quot; button is clicked.
</p>
<p> At first, an empty div container is placed on the page. The bind() function is used for the &quot;button&quot; element to assign a handler for the click event, which creates the map and puts it in the specified container when called.
</p>
<p> If the map has already been created when the button is clicked, the destroy() method is called and it destroys the map.
</p>
