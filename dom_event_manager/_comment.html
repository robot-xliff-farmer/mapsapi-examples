<p> Dom elements can generate different types of events, depending on the browser and device. For example, hovering the mouse over an object can generate the &#39;mousedown&#39; event, and touching an item on a tablet screen can generate the &#39;touchstart&#39; event. The Yandex.Maps API converts various browser events to a single list of events. This means you can write the same code for handling dom events in all browsers and on all devices that are supported by the API.

<p> To view the list of events the API uses and how events are transformed, see the description of the <sa href="IDomEventEmitter"/> interface. To subscribe to events on dom elements, you can use <sa href="domEvent.manager"/>.
