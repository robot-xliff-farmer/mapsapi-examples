    <p> In the example, when the map is clicked, a placemark appears with the address of the point that was clicked. </p>
<p> Here two events are listened for: a click on the map and dragging the marker. When one of them occurrs, a request is sent to the geocoder with the coordinates of the point at which the event occurred. The resulting address is recorded as the placemark content.
</p>
