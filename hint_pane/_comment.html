<div id="references"> <sa href="Hint"/>, <sa href="map.pane.Manager"/>
</div>
<p> A hint can be located outside the map container and displayed on top of other elements on the page (this is the default value). Alternatively, it can always stay inside the map. This is controlled by the &#39;pane&#39; option.
</p>
<p> Using a different option, &#39;fitPane&#39; (&#39;true&#39; by default), you can forcer the hint to move so that it is always displayed completely within the visible area of its container, without touching its boundaries and not causing the scrollbar to appear.
