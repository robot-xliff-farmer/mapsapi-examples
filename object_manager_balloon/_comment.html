<div id="references"> <sa href="ObjectManager"/>, <sa href="objectManager.Balloon"/>
</div>
<p> <sa href="ObjectManager"/> - class that allows you to add a large number of objects to the map without having to create placemarks separately.
</p>
<p> Objects added in ObjectManager are in the ObjectManager.objects collection. The clusters formed from the added placemarks are added to the ObjectManager.clusters collection.
</p>
<p> These collections have managers that control balloons and hints (ObjectManager.objects.balloon, ObjectManager.clusters.hint).
