</div>
<p> To build a <a href="/maps/doc/jsapi/2.1/dg/concepts/router.xml">route</a>, use the <sa href="route"/> function. This function is passed an array of points that the route must pass through and, if necessary, additional options for building the route.
</p>
<p> The route is calculated asynchronously (in other words, data is exchanged with the server while the route function is executing). The result is passed to the handler function as a <sa href="GeoObjectCollection"/> collection that can be placed on the map.
