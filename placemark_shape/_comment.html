<div id="references"> <sa href="Placemark"/>, <sa href="templateLayoutFactory"/>
</div> This example creates three placemarks with their own HTML layouts.<br/> Custom layouts are created using the layout factory.<br/> All layouts are assigned various hotspot shapes:rectangle, circle, or polygon. <br/><br/> The placemark uses the <a href="/maps/doc/jsapi/2.1/dg/concepts/about-hotspots.xml">hotspot</a> to catch mouse events.<br/> By default, the hotspot shape is not set when setting the HTML layout, and it has to be set separately.<br/> You can do this using the iconShape placemark option as a <sa href="IGeometryJson">JSON geometry description</sa>.
