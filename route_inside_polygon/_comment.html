<p> It is often necessary to draw a route between specified points, and then analyze in what areas or cities the segments of this route fall on. In this example, prepared data is used for creating a polygon defining the MKAD. After the route is received, a check is performed for whether its segments fall within this polygon using the method <sa href="GeoQueryResult#searchInside">searchInside</sa>.
</p>
<p> Using the <sa href="GeoQueryResult"/> object, you can set options or data for a group of geo objects at once. As shown here, the route segments that lie inside and outside the ring road are drawn in different colors.
