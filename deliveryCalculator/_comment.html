<p>This example shows how you can automatically build a route and calculate the cost of travel or delivery. If you click anywhere on the map or enter the desired address in the search box, a point is displayed on the map with a route drawn to it and information about the cost of the trip (delivery).
</p>
<p> To mark the starting and ending points, just click in the desired places on the map or enter addresses in the search boxes.
</p>
<p> When you click on the starting point placemark, a balloon opens with information about the route and cost of delivery.
